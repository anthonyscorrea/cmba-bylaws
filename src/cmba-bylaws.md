Roster changes shall be effective as of the first pitch of the team’s first regularly scheduled game after the updated roster is submitted.

Games played under the auspices of both recognized Managers of the participating teams shall count as official. A regulation game is defined as follows

1. A regulation game consists of seven (7) innings, unless extended because of a tie score, or shortened because the home team needs none of its half of the seventh inning or only a fraction of it, or because the umpire calls the game in accordance with [Reasons for a Game to be Called](#reasons-for-a-game-to-be-called).
1. If the score is tied after seven completed innings play shall continue until (1) the visiting team has scored more total runs than the home team at the end of a completed inning, or (2) the home team scores the winning run in an uncompleted inning. If a regulation game is called with the score tied, it shall remain a tie game.
1. If a game is called by the umpire, per [Reasons for a Game to be Called](#reasons-for-a-game-to-be-called), it is a regulation (official) game:

   The Slaughter Rule is applicable for the playoffs as specified in [Completion of Playoff Games](#completion-of-playoff-games).
1. If a game is called after 3 complete innings and one team is ahead by 10 or more runs, the game will be ended and the leading team declared the winner. 

   Postseason games are exempt from this definition as specified in [Completion of Playoff Games](#completion-of-playoff-games).

1. If a game is postponed or otherwise called before it has become a regulation game, the umpire-in-chief shall declare it “No Game,” meaning the game must be restarted (not resumed) at a later date.

   Postseason games are exempt from this definition as specified in [Completion of Playoff Games](#completion-of-playoff-games).

### Reasons for a Game to be Called
An umpire, in their discretion, may declare a game called if

If a ninth player does not arrive or arrives after forfeit time, the team shall be in technical forfeit, as defined in [Forfeits](#forfeits).

This replacement player must be the first player removed from the game, and if this player is unavailable the next player is used (and so on). If no reserve is present, the vacated spot in the lineup is skipped and all batters move up accordingly, with no penalty to the affected team.
